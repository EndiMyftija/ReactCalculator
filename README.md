# React Calculator Challenge

Welcome to the **React Calculator Challenge** repository. This project showcases a simple React-based calculator application that performs addition operations with interactive row controls. It was developed as part of a technical challenge to demonstrate proficiency in React

## Project Overview

This calculator allows users to dynamically add, remove, enable, or disable rows, where each row can have a positive or negative sign for its numerical input. The calculator continuously updates the sum of the enabled rows as values are modified, providing a responsive, "live" user experience.

### Core Functionalities
1. **Add/Remove Rows**: Users can add new rows and delete existing ones.
2. **Sign Selection**: Each row can be assigned a positive (+) or negative (âˆ’) sign.
3. **Enable/Disable Rows**: Rows can be enabled or disabled using a control button. Disabled rows are excluded from the calculation.
4. **Live Sum Calculation**: The sum updates in real-time as the user types.
